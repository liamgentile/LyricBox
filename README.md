# LyricBox
A neural network powered idea generator for artists with writer's block.

The web application for people to use LyricBox runs from Google Colaboratory and is built with Python, Streamlit, and Ngrok.

## Project Summary

### Premise

  The motivation behind this project started with wanting to explore the world of natural language processing. When doing research for this project I found many AI powered creative writing models to be impractical. I kept asking myself "do we really want AI to generate full works of art?" and "is the amount of computational power required really worth the typically low quality output?".  In looking for a more practical application of NLP in the space of art, the problem of writer's block popped into my mind. I wanted to investigate: can I use machine learning applied to past lyric data to generate ideas for an artist with writer's block? These would be short bursts of text generated in response to the user's prompt. 

  I decided to build three models, each trained on songs from their respective genres. This would allow for some stylistic customization of the idea generator. The three genres I chose are Folk, Pop, and Hip Hop.
